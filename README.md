#**Airbnb Clone Project**

This Python implementation serves as an emulation of Airbnb, featuring a command-line interpreter (utilizing the cmd module) to oversee diverse functionalities.

##**Command Interpreter (cmd module)**

The command interpreter facilitates user interaction with the Airbnb clone through a command-line interface, supporting commands for the management of listings, users, and bookings.

##**Getting Started**
To initiate the command-line interface, navigate to the repository and execute the command './console.py' after making it executable.

##**Usage Guide**
The command interpreter recognizes the following commands:

- 'create': Generate a new user, listing, or booking. Example: Create User
- 'show': Exhibit information about users, listings, or bookings. Example: show listing 123
- 'update': Modify information related to users, listings, or bookings. Example: update listing 123 name 'new listing name'
- 'destroy': Eradicate a listing, user, or booking. Example: destroy user 456
- 'all': Display all instances of a class or specific instances based on filters.
